as own child. They tough the girl to walk, read, hunt, and sing. As the small baby grew up, she become a pretty girl.

She decided that she wanted to go to college at the University of Wisconsin Madison. There she met a boy named Jorge. Jorge and her had met in a CS 400 class when they were studying Java programming. They giggled over making a program that laughed at people. As they grow closer so did the relationship one day when she was not expecting it Jorge got down on one knee just a tie her shoe. It was very awkward because she thought he was going to propose. But boy was she wrong. It was at that moment that Jorge stood up and dumped her.

On a chilly day in the fall, Jorge walked around the city as the trees lost their leaves. It reminded him of the binary trees that he had once designed with Stephanie. As Jorge contemplated the past, Stephanie simultaneously walked into his view. Realizing that he had broken her heart, he walked up to her and untied and retied her shows ten times to show that he was sorry. She accepted.
